### Research Field Summary:

I specialize in the intersection of social cognitive neuroscience and behavioral sciences, with a focus on understanding the cognitive and affective processes underlying human behavior. My research explores the neural mechanisms of decision-making, social cognition, and emotional processing, shedding light on how these processes influence behavior and drive social interactions. By leveraging advanced statistical analysis and experimental methodologies, I uncover insights into behavioral patterns and neural responses, contributing to a deeper understanding of human behavior and cognition.
